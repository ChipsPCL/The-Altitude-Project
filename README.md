# The Altitude Project

## Project Overview
Founded on the ETH Layer 2 Base Chain, **The Altitude Project** aims to create a unique DeFi ecosystem with a focus on deflationary tokenomics, rewarding experiences, and innovative revenue streams. Our mission is to ensure every Altitude token holder shares in the project's success, with a strong commitment to transparency, sustainability, and mutual growth.

At the heart of The Altitude Project is the **ALTITUDE token** – a reflective reward token designed to promote the HODLing mindset. ALTITUDE is more than just another token; it’s a vision that rewards loyal holders and fosters a sustainable journey for all participants.

Our approach combines deflationary mechanisms, user rewards, and fresh revenue generation, which positions us well for growth. The Altitude Project aims to drive the DeFi space forward, leveraging its ecosystem to grow sustainably and contribute to the broader DeFi landscape.

**Join us on this journey to new heights with ALTITUDE!**

## Contract Code Explanation
The ALTITUDE token contract is an ERC-20 token with custom tax functionalities tailored to support the project’s goals. Key aspects of the contract include:

- **Minting and Supply Management**: The entire supply is minted upon deployment, with no additional minting capabilities. Instead, the total supply decreases over time through a true burn function.
- **Transaction Taxes**: Custom taxes for buying, selling, and utility are incorporated to fund the project’s needs. Safeguards are in place to limit tax percentages, protecting holders from excessive taxation. Anti-whale and anti-bot mechanisms are included but have not been activated since launch.
- **ERC-20 Compatibility**: The contract follows standard ERC-20 guidelines, ensuring compatibility with decentralized exchanges, wallets, and other DeFi applications. Currently, the token is tradable on the Baseswap DEX as of 15th Nov 2024.
